## Simple Linear Regression
**Simple Linear Regression** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables:

* One **independent variable** (input, usually denoted as `x`)
* One **dependent variable** (output, usually denoted as `y`)

It fits a **straight line** (linear equation) to the data that best predicts the value of `y` based on `x`.

---

#### The Linear Equation

The model is defined as:

$$
\hat{y} = mx + b
$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}$ is the **predicted value**
* $x$ is the input variable
* $m$ is the **slope** of the line (how much y changes per unit change in x)
* $b$ is the **intercept** (value of y when x = 0)

---

#### Purpose

Simple linear regression is used to:

* **Predict outcomes** based on input
* **Understand the strength and direction** of the relationship between two variables
* **Quantify** the influence of one variable on another

---

#### Example

If we want to predict a student‚Äôs exam score based on hours studied:

* `x = hours studied`
* `y = exam score`

Simple linear regression would find the **best straight line** through the data points to model this relationship.


### Goal of Simple Linear Regression

We are trying to **model the relationship** between:

* One **independent variable** $x$ (e.g., hours studied)
* One **dependent variable** $y$ (e.g., exam score)

We assume that the relationship between them is **linear**, so we want to fit a straight line:

$$
\hat{y} = mx + b
$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}$ is the **predicted value**
* $m$ is the **slope** (how much y changes for each unit change in x)
* $b$ is the **intercept** (value of y when x = 0)

---

### Step 1: The Core Idea ‚Äî Fit a Line That Minimizes Error

We want to choose the values of `m` and `b` such that the predicted values $\hat{y}$ are as close as possible to the actual values $y$.

So the **core problem** becomes:

> Find `m` and `b` that minimize the total prediction error.

---

### Step 2: Measuring "How Wrong" We Are ‚Äî Loss Function

To do this, we use a **loss function**. The most common choice is **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

Why MSE?

* It penalizes large errors more than small ones (because of squaring)
* It's smooth and differentiable (so we can optimize it easily)
* It gives a clear geometric interpretation: average squared vertical distance from the actual points to the line

So:

> Lower MSE means better line fit.

### üîß Step 3: Optimizing the Line ‚Äî Using Calculus

We want to **minimize the MSE**. There are two ways:

#### 1. **Analytical method** (closed-form solution):

We use calculus to derive formulas for the best `m` and `b` directly. This works for small/simple problems.

#### 2. **Gradient Descent** (iterative optimization):

This is more flexible and generalizable (especially when data or models get complex). We take steps in the direction that reduces the MSE.

---

### Step 4: Gradient Descent ‚Äî How It Works

#### Key concept:

We treat the MSE as a **surface** over parameters `m` and `b`. Gradient descent is like a ball rolling downhill toward the lowest point (minimum loss).

At each step:

1. Compute the **gradient** (partial derivatives) of MSE w\.r.t. `m` and `b`:

   * $\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m} = -\frac{2}{n} \sum x_i(y_i - \hat{y}_i)$
   * $\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b} = -\frac{2}{n} \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)$

2. Update parameters:

   * $m = m - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m}$
   * $b = b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b}$

   Here, $\alpha$ is the **learning rate** ‚Äî it controls how big the steps are.

3. Repeat until the updates get very small (converge).

### üîÅ Step 5: Model Converges to Best-Fit Line

After many iterations, gradient descent finds values for `m` and `b` that **minimize the MSE** ‚Äî in other words, the **best-fit line** through the data.

Now, this line can be used to **predict** values of `y` for new inputs `x`.

## **mathematical derivation**
Let's walk through the **mathematical derivation** of the gradients of the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function for **simple linear regression** with respect to the parameters:

* $m$: the slope (weight)
* $b$: the y-intercept (bias)

---

### üß† **Model Equation**

$$
\hat{y}_i = mx_i + b
$$

Where:

* $x_i$: input feature
* $y_i$: true label
* $\hat{y}_i$: predicted output

---

### üéØ **Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

For $n$ training samples, the MSE is:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (mx_i + b - y_i)^2
$$

We want to compute:

* $\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m}$
* $\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b}$

---

### üßÆ **Step-by-Step Derivative with Respect to $m$**

Start with:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (mx_i + b - y_i)^2
$$

Let $e_i = (mx_i + b - y_i)$

Then:

$$
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 e_i \cdot \frac{\partial e_i}{\partial m}
$$

Since:

$$
\frac{\partial e_i}{\partial m} = x_i
$$

So:

$$
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m} = \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (mx_i + b - y_i) \cdot x_i
$$

---

### üßÆ **Step-by-Step Derivative with Respect to $b$**

Similarly:

$$
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 e_i \cdot \frac{\partial e_i}{\partial b}
$$

Since:

$$
\frac{\partial e_i}{\partial b} = 1
$$

So:

$$
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b} = \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (mx_i + b - y_i)
$$

---

### ‚ú® Final Gradient Formulas

$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m} = \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (mx_i + b - y_i) \cdot x_i
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b} = \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (mx_i + b - y_i)
}
$$

These derivatives are used in **gradient descent** to update $m$ and $b$:

$$
m := m - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial m}
$$

$$
b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial b}
$$

Where $\alpha$ is the **learning rate**.
